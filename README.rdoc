== DESCRIPTION:

RForce is a simple, usable binding to the Salesforce API.

{<img src="https://travis-ci.org/undees/rforce.png" />}[https://travis-ci.org/undees/rforce]

== FEATURES:

Rather than enforcing adherence to the sforce.com schema, RForce assumes you are familiar with the API. Ruby method names become SOAP method names. Nested Ruby hashes become nested XML elements.

== SYNOPSIS:

=== Logging in with a user name and password

  binding = RForce::Binding.new \
    'https://www.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/20.0'

  binding.login \
    'email', 'password' + 'token'

=== Logging in with OAuth

  oauth = {
    :consumer_key    => '...', # Tokens obtained from Salesforce
    :consumer_secret => '...',
    :access_token    => '...',
    :access_secret   => '...',
    :login_url       => 'https://login.salesforce.com/services/OAuth/u/20.0'
  }

  binding = RForce::Binding.new \
    'https://www.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/20.0',
    nil,
    oauth

  binding.login_with_oauth

=== Finding a record

  answer = binding.search \
    :searchString =>
      'find {McFakerson Co} in name fields returning account(id)'

  account = answer.searchResponse.result.searchRecords.record
  account_id = account.Id

=== Creating a record

  opportunity = [
                 :type,      'Opportunity',
                 :accountId, account_id,
                 :amount,    '10.00',
                 :name,      'Fakey McFakerson',
                 :closeDate, '2008-07-04',
                 :stageName, 'Closed Won'
                ]

  binding.create :sObject => opportunity
